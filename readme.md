This project is our effort in creating a machine learning model that can predict the stock prices for some prominent companies like APPL, GOOGL, META, TSLA and AMZN.
Although this project is far from what a realtime ML solution looks like we have managed to create a working web application that serves the purpose.
As we take a moment to reflect on our journey with this project, I believe it's crucial to document our insights, challenges, and recommendations for future enhancements. This description aims to provide an overview of our experiences and suggestions for improvement.

1. **Domain Knowledge:**
   Reflecting on our journey, it's evident that a stronger foundation in stock market dynamics and indicators would have significantly improved the accuracy and relevance of our model. In future endeavors, dedicating time to acquiring domain expertise or collaborating with experts should have been made.

2. **Streamlit Application:**
   Our collective venture into building a Streamlit web application was a commendable effort, but we acknowledged that there's room for improvement in terms of user interface and functionality. Enhancing the design, incorporating more interactive features, and possibly seeking inspiration from other successful financial platforms could elevate the user experience.

3. **Base Model Creation:**
   The decision to train the model with each query has proven to be inefficient. Moving forward, we should invest time in creating a robust base model optimized for our specific dataset. This not only reduces computational overhead but also ensures consistency and reliability in predictions.

4. **Model Selection:**
   While we successfully implemented a model, it's clear that there are more specialized models tailored for stock price prediction. Exploring the potential of LSTM networks or other time series forecasting models, and conducting a thorough model comparison, will be key to improving the accuracy of our predictions.

5. **Evaluation Metrics:**
   The choice of evaluation metric, rooted in general regression practices, may not have been the most suitable for our stock market prediction. Investigating metrics like Mean Absolute Error or Mean Absolute Percentage Error that align better with the stock market's sensitivity to small variations would be beneficial.

6. **Visualization:**
   Our use of Matplotlib served the purpose, but we recognize the potential for improvement in visualization. Experimenting with advanced libraries like Plotly or Seaborn and incorporating interactive elements will not only enhance the aesthetics but also provide a more dynamic exploration of data and predictions.

In conclusion, this project has been a valuable learning experience, and while we accept its current state with gains in knowledge, it's crucial to leverage these insights for continuous improvement. By addressing the identified areas, we can enhance the functionality, efficiency, and impact of our stock price prediction application in future iterations.
